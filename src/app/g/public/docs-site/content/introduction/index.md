## What is TipoTapp?
TipoTapp is a Platform as a Service product that enables you to visually create fully-functional cloud-native applications without writing a single line of code.

To create an application, you use the Application Editor that is available via browser to model the application's data which then becomes ready and immediately accessible to your users. There is nothing to download or install to use the application. As soon as an app is built on TipoTapp, it is hosted on TipoTapp's cloud infrastructure where it can be accessed from any device. Users can then retrieve, create and modify its data with strict adherence to their roles and access controls.

Applications built on TipoTapp use state of the art serverless computing architecture with the ability to grow elastically in the cloud on-demand. As soon as the application is modelled, it is instantly accessible without any deployments. Applications built on TipoTapp can service millions of customers and are very economical to both you and your application customers.
